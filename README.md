# wordsearch-generator


A simple program that will allow users to generate random wordsearches using a pool of words that can either be manually entered or chosen from a set of already existing words based on themes.

Words are inserted into the board randomly and can be forwards, backwards, diagonal, and even share letters with other words in the wordsearch.

The wordsearch is outputted to a file titled wordSearch.txt
